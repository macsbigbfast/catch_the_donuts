# Project Title

Welcome! I have published here my first project created during software engineering bootcamp - a game developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Project Description

This game, Catch the Donuts, is inspired by the Neopets game, Hasee Bounce. You can watch a video of the original gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-AAhkeYDE8&ab_channel=SparkleSillies). 

Within the game, the player has 2 characters that they can control, when it's the character's turn to move. There are donuts that fly across the screen, and the goal of the game is to catch as many donuts as possible within the 60 seconds game duration.

The game I have developed is a watered-down version of the original. I would like to revisit in the future to add the following features:
* Bonus donuts that grant extra points
* Flying poop that decreases the time when collision occurs
* Making the donuts fly in from left & the right
* Build a see-saw for the characters to jump on
